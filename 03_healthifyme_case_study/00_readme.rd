Problem Statement :

Attached a dump of slots booked by free users over 2 months with our coaches. The leads are separated by funnel - Bot / Free-Trial and Lead Type - With/without medical condition and India/NRI.

 

All consultations are free and the objective is to upsell premium subscriptions. Purchase can be identified with the payment time filter. Coaches are divided into Target Classes basis their ability to sell. 'A' being the best in sales and 'D' being the worst. The data of the actual users and coaches have been masked.

 

- What's the 3-day and 7-day conversion of different lead types split by funnels.

- What hours work best for connectivity and sales?

- Come up with insights on how best would you optimize the slots, coach, and funnels for the most efficient outcome (conversions).

- Are there any other insights you can come up with using this data

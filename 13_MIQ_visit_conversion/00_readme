Problem 1: The client is an online ecommerce player. They have shared a user level log data for
their browsing behavior (Timestamp, UserId and website section visited). You have been
provided with the final conversion data too (Timestamp, UserID, Products Purchased in the
transaction, Overall Cart Value). Based on this data you are required to build features and model
on these characteristics of users to calculate a score/rank for conversion probability of that user.
These scores will eventually decide the bidding logic used for each user.
